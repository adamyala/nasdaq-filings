CEO,Christopher D. Pappas
Company Description,"We are a leading global materials company engaged in the manufacture and
marketing of emulsion polymers and plastics, including various specialty and
technologically differentiated products. We have leading market positions in
many of the markets in which we compete. We believe we have developed> these
strong market positions due to our technological differentiation, diverse global
manufacturing base, long-standing customer relationships, commitment to
sustainable solutions and competitive cost positions. We believe that growth in
overall consumer spending and construction activity, increased demand in the
automotive industry for higher fuel efficiency and lighter-weight materials, and
improving living standards in emerging markets will result in growth in the
global markets in which we compete. In addition, we believe our increasing
business presence in developing regions such as China, Southeast Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe further enhances our prospects.

We develop emulsion polymers and plastics products that are incorporated into a
wide range of our customers’ products throughout the world, including tires and
other products for automotive applications, carpet and artificial turf backing,
coated paper and packaging board, food service packaging, appliances, medical
devices, consumer electronics and construction applications, among others. We
seek to regularly develop new and improved products and processes, supported by
our strong patent portfolio, designed to enhance our customers’ product
offerings. We have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of global
customers, many of whom are leaders in their markets and rely on us for
formulation, technological differentiation, and compounding expertise to find
sustainable solutions for their businesses. Many of our products represent only
a small portion of a finished product’s production costs, but provide critical
functionality to the finished product and are often specifically developed to
customer specifications. We believe these product traits result in substantial
customer loyalty for our products.

We have significant manufacturing and production operations around the world,
which allows us to serve our global customer base. As of December 31, 2013, our
production facilities included 35 manufacturing plants (which included a total
of 83 production units) at 27 sites across 14 countries, including joint
ventures and contract manufacturers. Our manufacturing locations include sites
in high-growth emerging markets such as China, Indonesia and Brazil.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2013 we operated 11 research and development
(“R&amp;D”) facilities globally, including mini plants, development centers and
pilot coaters, which we believe are critical to our global presence and
innovation capabilities.

We are a global business with a diverse geographic revenue mix and significant
operations around the world.

In 2013, we generated net sales of $5,307.4 million, adjusted EBITDA of $303.3
million and a net loss of $22.2 million. 

We operate in four reporting segments under two business units. Our Emulsion
Polymers business unit includes our Latex reporting segment and our Synthetic
Rubber reporting segment. Our Plastics business unit includes our Styrenics
reporting segment and our Engineered Polymers reporting segment.

.  Latex: In our Latex segment we produce a broad range of products, including 
   styrene-butadiene latex (“SB latex”), styrene-acrylate latex (“SA latex”), 
   vinylidene chloride latex as well as performance latex products. We are a 
   global leader in SB latex, holding a strong market position across the 
   geographies and applications in which we compete, including the #1 position 
   in SB latex in Europe and the #2 position in North America, based on 
   production capacity. Our customers use SB latex primarily for coated paper 
   used in advertising and magazines, packaging board coatings, carpet and 
   artificial turf backings, as well as a number of performance latex 
   applications. We believe our R&amp;D and formulation capabilities contribute to 
   our strong position. Further, we believe we have strong growth prospects in 
   latex through our leading position in China, where we have recently announced
   an expansion of our SB latex capacity.

.  Synthetic Rubber: In our Synthetic Rubber segment we produce styrene-
   butadiene- and polybutadiene-based rubber products including solution 
   styrene-butadiene rubber, or SSBR, our most advanced rubber technology. SSBR 
   is a critical material for tires with low rolling resistance, which increases
   fuel efficiency and improves wet-grip and also leads to better traction and 
   safety characteristics. We have a leading market position in SSBR in Europe 
   where tire producers focus on high-performance and ultra high-performance 
   tires and rely heavily on third party rubber producers. Our growth in this 
   segment is also supported by regulatory reforms in the EU, Japan and Korea 
   that are aimed at improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide 
   emissions. We have recently doubled our SSBR production capacity to allow us
   to continue to capitalize on the strong demand growth that we anticipate for
   this product.                    

.  Styrenics: In our Styrenics segment we produce polystyrene, acrylonitrile 
   butadiene styrene (“ABS”) and styrene acrylonitrile (“SAN”) products, as 
   well as our internal production and sourcing of styrene monomer, a raw    
   material common in SB latex, synthetic rubber and styrenics products. We  
   are a leading producer of polystyrene and Mass ABS (“mABS”) where we focus
   our efforts on differentiated applications such as the liners and 
   encasements of appliances and consumer electronics, including smartphones 
   and tablets. Within these applications, we work collaboratively with      
   customers to develop products that offer superior properties, such as     
   rigidity, insulation and colorability, and, in some cases, an improved    
   environmental footprint compared to general purpose polystyrene or emulsion 
   ABS. We believe our growth prospects in our Styrenics segment are enhanced
   by recent trends of industry capacity reduction and consolidation. Between
   2006 and 2011, approximately 1,000,000 metric tons, or 1,000 kMT, of      
   production capacity was eliminated in the United States and Western Europe
   (or approximately 20% of 2005 total capacity in those regions). This trend
   has continued with the recent formation of the Styrolution Group GmbH     
   joint venture, combining certain INEOS and BASF Group assets, and further 
   asset rationalizations by INEOS and Styrolution Group GmbH. We also have a
   50% interest in Americas Styrenics LLC, our joint venture with Chevron    
   Phillips Chemical Company, which operates in the North American and Latin 
   American markets and has benefitted from recent consolidation trends in   
   North America.                                                            

.  Engineered Polymers: In our Engineered Polymers segment we produce        
   polycarbonate (“PC”), compounds and blends, and polypropylene compounds. We 
   believe we are a leading global producer of PC and PC blends, and our  
   products are predominantly used in the automotive, consumer electronics,  
   construction, and medical device markets. Many of our PC compounds and    
   blends products are differentiated based on their physical properties,    
   performance and aesthetic advantage. We believe our growth prospects in this
   segment are bolstered by consumer and manufacturer demands for lighter-
   weight and impact-resistant products as well as improving utilization rates.

Company Description,"We are a global medical device company focused on designing, developing and 
commercializing innovative and proprietary complex spine technologies and 
techniques. Our complex spine products are used by spine surgeons to treat some 
of the most difficult and challenging spinal pathologies, such as> deformity 
(primarily scoliosis), trauma and tumor. We believe these procedures typically 
receive a higher rate of positive insurance coverage and often generate more 
revenue per procedure as compared to traditional degenerative spine surgery 
procedures. We have applied our product development expertise in innovating 
complex spine technologies and techniques to the design, development and 
commercialization of an expanding number of minimally invasive surgery, or 
MIS, products. These proprietary MIS products are designed to allow for less 
invasive access to the spine and faster patient recovery times as compared to 
traditional open access surgical approaches. We have also leveraged these core 
competencies in the design, development and commercialization of an increasing 
number of products for patients suffering from degenerative spinal conditions.

Our products consist of implants, disposables and instruments which are 
marketed and sold primarily to hospitals for use by spine surgeons. During our 
10 year history, we have commercialized 57 product lines that are used in 
complex spine surgery, MIS and degenerative procedures, enabling us to 
favorably compete in the $10.0 billion global spinal surgery market. Of our 57 
commercialized product lines, our MESA technology or products that incorporate 
MESA have accounted for approximately 39%, 37% and 35% of our revenue for the 
years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. While the quality, 
safety and efficacy of our marketed products are not yet supported by long-term 
clinical data, we believe many of our products provide several benefits, 
including:

. simplified surgical techniques; 

. less invasive access to implant sites; 

. enhanced capabilities to manipulate and correct the spinal column; 

. lower profile spinal implant technology; and 

. improved clinical outcomes. 

In addition to our current product portfolio, we continue to invest in the 
design, development and commercialization of new solutions for unmet clinical 
needs in the complex spine and MIS markets by leveraging our highly efficient 
product development process. We have introduced 34 new product lines since the 
beginning of 2011 demonstrating our ability to leverage this product 
development process to rapidly innovate new products.

Our focus on our core competences of complex spine and MIS is highlighted by 
the fact that, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, 59%, 60% 
and 58%, respectively, of our revenue in the United States was derived from the 
use of our products in complex spine and MIS surgeries. We believe this 
represents a greater proportion of total revenue devoted to these markets as 
compared to our competitors. We further believe the proportion of our 
international revenue derived from complex spine and MIS is even higher than in 
the United States.

Company Description,"We are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the United
States. Our roots in consumer finance trace back to 1932, and today we are the
largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States based on
purchase volume and receivables. We provide a range of credit> products through
programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional
retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations
and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our “partners.” Through
our partners’ 329,000 locations across the United States and Canada, and their
websites and mobile applications, we offer their customers a variety of credit
products to finance the purchase of goods and services. During 2013, we financed
$93.9 billion of sales, and at December 31, 2013, we had $57.3 billion of loan
receivables and 62.0 million active accounts. Our active accounts represent a
geographically diverse group of both consumers and businesses, with an average
FICO score of 714 for consumer active accounts. Our business has been profitable
and resilient, including through the recent U.S. financial crisis and ensuing
years. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we had net earnings of $2.0
billion, representing a return on assets of 3.5%.

Our business benefits from longstanding and collaborative relationships with our
partners, including some of the nation’s leading retailers and manufacturers
with well-known consumer brands, such as Lowe’s, Wal-Mart, Amazon and Ethan
Allen. We believe our partner-centric business model has been successful because
it aligns our interests with those of our partners and provides substantial
value to both our partners and our customers. Our partners promote our credit
products because they generate increased sales and strengthen customer loyalty.
Our customers benefit from instant access to credit, discounts and promotional
offers. We differentiate ourselves through deep partner integration and our
extensive marketing expertise. We have omni-channel (in-store, online and
mobile) technology and marketing capabilities, which allow us to offer and
deliver our credit products instantly to customers across multiple channels. The
purchase volume from our online and mobile channels increased 62% from 2010 to
2013.

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, GE
Capital Retail Bank, which is to be renamed Synchrony Bank in connection with
this offering (the “Bank”). Through the Bank, we offer a range of deposit
products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”),
including certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”),
money market accounts and savings accounts, under our Optimizer+Plus brand,
directly to retail and commercial customers. We also take deposits at the Bank
through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured
deposit products to their customers. We are expanding our online direct banking
operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified
low cost funding for our credit activities. We had $25.7 billion in deposits at
December 31, 2013.

Company Website,http://www.papamurphys.com
CEO,Ken Calwell
Company Description,"Papa Murphy’s is a high-growth franchisor and operator of the largest Take ‘N’
Bake pizza chain in the United States. Take ‘N’ Bake pizza restaurants sell
uncooked pizzas that customers bake at home. We were founded in 1981 and have
grown our footprint to a total of 1,418 franchise and> company-owned stores
(collectively “system-wide stores”) as of December 30, 2013, more than 20 times
the stores of our nearest Take ‘N’ Bake pizza restaurant competitor. The Papa
Murphy’s experience is different from traditional pizza restaurants. Our
customers:

. CREATE their fresh, customized pizza with high-quality ingredients in our  
  stores or online;                                                          

. TAKE their fresh pizza home; and

. BAKE their pizza fresh in their ovens, at their convenience, for a         
  home-cooked meal served hot.                                               

We have been repeatedly rated the #1 pizza chain in the United States by
multiple third-party consumer studies. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we were rated the
#1 pizza chain overall by Nation’s Restaurant News, and in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
we were rated the #1 pizza chain by Zagat. Compared to broader restaurant chain
competition, we were also recognized by Technomic in 2013 as the #1 chain
overall among all restaurants and all food categories, by Nation’s Restaurant
News in 2013 and 2012 as one of the Top 5 Overall limited service restaurant
chains across all food categories, and by Zagat in 2012 as one of the Top 5
Overall fast food chains across all food categories. For fiscal years 2013 and
2012 we had total revenues of $80.5 million and $66.9 million, respectively, net
income (loss) of $(2.6) million and $(2.1) million, respectively, and Adjusted
EBITDA of $24.4 million and $22.1 million, respectively.

We believe our leading consumer ratings are due to the broad appeal of our
concept. However, we actively target mothers and families looking to solve the
“dinnertime dilemma” of providing their family with a high-quality, home-cooked
meal, without investing significant time or money. We believe that our target
customer values the focus on freshness and quality that differentiates the Papa
Murphy’s pizza-making process:

. We make our dough fresh in each store, starting with flour, water and yeast;

. We grate our cheese daily from blocks of 100% whole-milk mozzarella cheese;

. We slice fresh, never-frozen vegetables by hand;

. We feature specialty, premium ingredients like artichoke hearts, sun-dried 
  tomatoes, feta cheese and fresh spinach;                                   

. We use only high-quality meats with no added fillers; and

. We use no trans-fats.

Additionally, our guidelines provide that all pizza dough must be used to make
pizzas within 72 hours of preparation, and we recommend our customers bake their
pizza within 24 hours of preparation, resulting in a fresh pizza for our
customers.

Our store model is also different from many other restaurant models. Because our
stores do not have pizza ovens, venting hoods, freezers or dining areas and
average 1,400 square feet in size, they require a lower capital investment than
traditional pizza, limited service or fast casual restaurants. We also have
lower operating costs than traditional pizza, limited service or fast casual
restaurants because our stores do not require the hiring of delivery drivers or
wait staff. Further, the simplicity of our operations and our shorter opening
hours (typically 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.) are attractive to potential and
current franchise owners and allow them to focus on making fresh, high-quality
food for our customers.

As of December 30, 2013, our store base was 95.1% franchised, offering us
strategic and financial benefits. Our franchise business model enables us to
focus our company resources on menu innovation, marketing, franchise owner
training and operations support and other initiatives to drive the overall
success of our brand. Our franchise business model also allows us to grow our
store base and brand awareness with limited corporate capital investment. As a
result, our business model is designed to provide us with high operating
margins, low capital expenditures, negative working capital and high operating
cash flows.

As of December 30, 2013, we had 1,418 system-wide stores, consisting of 1,349
franchise and 69 company-owned stores, located in 38 states, Canada and the
United Arab Emirates. We have increased our total store count 68.6% from 2004 to
2013. We currently have a strong new store pipeline and our franchise owners
opened 98 stores in 2013, which represents a 27.3% increase in franchise store
openings over the prior fiscal year. We have also experienced steady increases
in our system-wide sales. From 2004 to 2013, our system-wide sales increased
from $385.9 million to $785.6 million.

We have experienced strong comparable store sales, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
growth. Our stores have generated positive comparable store sales growth in 35
out of the last 40 quarters through the end of fiscal year 2013, averaging
approximately 4% throughout the last ten years. From fiscal year 2009 to fiscal
year 2013, our total revenues increased from $54.1 million to $80.5 million, and
Adjusted EBITDA increased from $16.5 million to $24.4 million. In fiscal year
2009, we had net income of $4.5 million compared to a net loss of $(2.6) million
in fiscal year 2013.

CEO,Douglas A. Cifu
Company Description,"Virtu is a leading technology-enabled market maker and liquidity provider to the
global financial markets. We stand ready, at any time, to buy or sell a broad 
range of securities, and we generate revenue by buying and selling large volumes
of securities and other financial instruments and earning> small amounts of money
based on the difference between what buyers are willing to pay and what sellers 
are willing to accept, which we refer to as ""bid/ask spreads."" We make markets 
by providing quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 10,000 securities and
other financial instruments on more than 210 unique exchanges, markets and 
liquidity pools in 30 countries around the world. We believe that our broad 
diversification, in combination with our proprietary technology platform and 
low-cost structure, enables us to facilitate risk transfer between global 
capital markets participants by supplying liquidity and competitive pricing 
while at the same time earning attractive margins and returns.

We believe that market makers like us serve an important role in maintaining and
improving the overall health and efficiency of the global capital markets by 
continuously posting bids and offers for securities and other financial 
instruments and thereby providing to market participants an efficient means to 
transfer risk. All market participants benefit from the increased liquidity, 
lower overall trading costs and enhanced execution certainty that we provide. 
While in most cases we do not have customers in a traditional sense, we make 
markets for global banks, brokers and other intermediaries, in addition to 
retail and institutional investors, including corporations, individuals, hedge
funds, mutual funds, pension funds and other investors, all of whom desire to
transfer risk in multiple securities and asset classes for their own accounts

     We refer to our market making activities as being ""market neutral,"" which
means that we are not dependent on the direction of a particular market and do
not speculate. Our market making activities are designed to minimize capital at
risk at any given time by limiting the notional size of our positions. Our
strategies are also designed to lock in returns through precise and nearly
instantaneous hedging, as we seek to eliminate the price risk in any positions
held. Our revenue generation is driven primarily by transaction volume across a
broad range of securities, asset classes and geographies. We avoid the risk of
long or short positions in favor of earning small bid/ask spreads on large
trading volumes across thousands of securities and other financial instruments.
We do not engage in the types of principal investing and predictive, momentum
and signal trading in which many other broker-dealers and trading firms engage.
In fact, in order to minimize the likelihood of unintended activities by our
market making strategies, if our risk management system detects a trading
strategy generating revenues outside of our preset limits, it will freeze, or
""lockdown,"" that strategy and alert risk management personnel and management.
Although this approach may prevent us from maximizing potential returns in times
of extreme market volatility, we believe the reduction in risk is an appropriate
trade-off that is in keeping with our aim of generating consistently strong
revenue from trading.
---

Technology and operational efficiency are at the core of our business, and our 
focus on market making technology is a key element of our success. We have
developed a proprietary, multi-asset, multi-currency technology platform that is
highly reliable, scalable and modular, and we integrate directly with exchanges
and other liquidity centers. Our market data, order routing, transaction
processing, risk management and market surveillance technology modules manage
our market making activities in an efficient manner and enable us to scale our
market making activities globally and across additional securities and other
financial instruments and asset classes without significant incremental costs or
third-party licensing or processing fees.

Company Description,"Phibro Animal Health Corporation is one of the leading animal health companies
in the world and is dedicated to helping meet the growing demand for animal
protein. We are a global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition
company. For nearly 40 years we have been committed to providing> livestock
producers with value-based products and solutions to help them maintain and
enhance the health and productivity of their animals. We sell more than 1,100
product presentations in over 65 countries to approximately 2,850 customers. We
develop, manufacture and market products for a broad range of food animals
including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. Our products
help prevent, control and treat diseases, enhance nutrition to help improve
health and performance and contribute to balanced mineral nutrition.

We believe we are the only global company with an animal health business that
concentrates exclusively on animals for human consumption and are one of the few
global companies offering a comprehensive range of animal health and mineral
nutrition products. We believe our key products such as Stafac®, Nicarb®, and
OmniGen-AF® (“OmniGen”) enjoy strong brand name recognition and customer
loyalty in the markets we serve. We believe our vaccines are recognized as a
standard in efficacy against highly virulent disease challenges and our patented
TAbic® vaccine delivery technology provides superior convenience and logistical
benefits over conventional glass bottles. The foundation of our product
portfolio is based on several key proprietary molecules and formulations that
are supported by additional complementary products, which help address important
customer needs. As an example of our portfolio depth, we believe over
5.4 billion of the 8.5 billion broiler chickens produced in the United States in
2012 received at least one of our products.

We are further differentiated by our team of highly trained and dedicated
professionals who provide technical service and support for our products and
offer practical solutions to our customers. Within our Animal Health and Mineral
Nutrition segments, utilizing both our sales, marketing and technical support
organization of approximately 225 employees and a broad distribution network, we
market our portfolio of more than 1,000 product presentations to livestock
producers and veterinarians in over 65 countries. Technical support and research
is an important aspect of our overall sales effort. Our global reach allows us
to connect with key global customers at their corporate, regional and local
decision-making levels, and we are implementing a strategy for working with our
customers with the broadest and most complex needs by assigning a key account
manager to have global responsibility for leading our sales, service, product
supply and strategic relationship commitments to these customers (our “Global
Key Account Strategy”). We believe our close contact with customers provides us
with an in-depth understanding of their businesses and allows us to identify and
develop products to address unmet customer needs, anticipate emerging trends and
establish ourselves as trusted advisors to our customers.

We have focused our efforts in high value geographies (regions where the
majority of livestock production is consolidated in large commercial farms) such
as the United States, Brazil, China, Russia, Mexico, Australia, Turkey, Israel,
Canada and Europe, and we believe we are well positioned to further accelerate
our growth with our established network of sales, marketing and distribution
professionals in emerging markets in Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and
Africa.

In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and
market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, automotive, industrial
chemical and chemical catalyst industries.

developing our sealing technology. The Ovation System, our solution for the
treatment of AAA through minimally invasive endovascular aortic repair, or EVAR,
is a new stent graft platform, providing an innovative and effective alternative
to conventional devices. It is designed to specifically address many of the
limitations associated with conventional EVAR devices and expand the pool of
patients eligible for EVAR.

We received CE Mark clearance for the Ovation System from the European
Commission in August 2010 and approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, in October 2012. The Ovation System consists of a main
aortic body, injected with a conformable polymer, and typically two iliac limbs.
These components allow the device to be customized to a patient’s unique anatomy
to effectively treat and seal the aneurysm. Our differentiated platform, by
virtue of its low profile, flexible delivery system and novel sealing mechanism,
offers physicians and patients eligible for EVAR a new solution to AAA repair,
and has the added benefit of being able to treat a broader population of
patients.

We believe we have an opportunity to rapidly increase the adoption and use of
the Ovation System by further investing in our sales infrastructure, generating
additional clinical data and expanding our professional education efforts. As of
January 31, 2014, our Ovation System has been used to treat more than 3,000
patients in over 25 countries, both in clinical trials and commercially. We
market and sell our products through direct sales organizations in the United
States, Germany and the United Kingdom. In other markets, we market and sell our
products through distributors. We began selling the Ovation System commercially
in the United States in November 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our
total revenue was $19.5 million, and our net loss was $50.3 million. Our
accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2013 was $238.5 million.

In our Ovation Pivotal Trial for EVAR, we validated the safety and efficacy of
the Ovation System through both femoral cut-down access and less invasive
percutaneous access, or PEVAR, and received FDA approval for both access
techniques. We have available four-year clinical data and comprehensive two-year
follow-up data from our Ovation Pivotal Trial, and we intend to continue to
invest in clinical studies and registries to demonstrate the patient, physician
and cost benefits of our low profile Ovation System. Based on the available data
from our Ovation Pivotal trial, we believe the low profile, flexible delivery
system and novel sealing mechanism of the Ovation System offers more patients
the opportunity to be treated less invasively, more efficiently and potentially
more cost effectively through decreased anesthesia, shorter procedural time and
hospital stay, and fewer complications, and will provide advantages to many
patients, physicians and payors.

Our corporate headquarters and vertically integrated production facilities are 
located in Santa Rosa, California. We have an experienced executive leadership 
team, maintain substantial research and development capabilities and hold an 
extensive patent portfolio.

CEO,Chad Richison
Company Description,"We are a leading provider of a comprehensive, cloud-based human capital
management, or HCM, software solution delivered as Software-as-a-Service, or
SaaS. We provide functionality and data analytics that businesses need to manage
the complete employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement.> Our solution
requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record
maintained in a single database for all HCM functions, including talent
acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human
resources, or HR, management applications. Our user-friendly software allows for
easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their
HCM activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on
employers and increases employee productivity.

Organizations need sophisticated, flexible and intuitive applications that can
quickly adapt to their evolving HCM requirements, streamline their HR processes
and systems and enable them to control costs. We believe that the HCM needs of
most organizations are currently served either by legacy providers offering
outdated on-premise products or multiple providers that partner together in an
attempt to replicate a comprehensive product. These approaches often result in
large up-front capital requirements, extended delivery times, high costs, low
scalability and challenges with system integration. According to the
International Data Corporation, or IDC, the U.S. markets for payroll services
and HCM applications will collectively total approximately $22.5 billion in
2014, and we believe there is a substantial opportunity for our solution to
address these HCM needs.

Because our solution was developed in-house and is based on a single platform,
there is no need to integrate, update or access multiple databases, which are
common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple third-party systems in
order to link together their HCM offerings. Additionally, our solution maintains
data integrity for accurate, actionable and real-time analytics and business
intelligence and helps clients minimize the risk of compliance errors due to
inaccurate or missing information. We deliver feature-rich applications while
maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards
as evidenced by our International Organization for Standardization, or ISO,
certifications. As a part of our client retention effort, a specialist within a
dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industry-leading,
personalized service.

The key benefits of our differentiated solution as compared to competing
products are:

.  Comprehensive HCM solution;

.  Core system of record enabling data analytics maintained on a single 
   database;                                                                 

.  Personalized support provided by trained personnel;

.  Software-as-a-Service delivery model;

.  Cloud-based architecture; and

.  Scalability to grow with our clients.

We sell our solution directly through our internally trained, client-focused and
highly skilled sales force based in offices across the United States. We have
over 10,000 clients, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent
of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. We believe that as a
result of our focus on client retention, we enjoy high client satisfaction as
evidenced by an average annual revenue retention rate of 91% from existing
clients for the three years ended December 31, 2013. We believe our revenue
retention rate understates our client loyalty because this rate also includes
former clients that were acquired or otherwise ceased operations.

Since our founding in Oklahoma City in 1998, we have focused on providing an 
innovative SaaS HCM solution. As of December 31, 2013, we had 840 employees 
across the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, 
our revenues were $107.6 million, $76.8 million, and $57.2 million, 
respectively, representing year-over-year growth in revenues of 40% and 34%, 
respectively. We currently derive most of our revenues from our payroll and tax 
management applications, which we refer to as payroll processing. We realized 
net income of $7.7 million, $4.2 million and $1.4 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

CEO,Simon Hubbert
Company Description,"We are a medical technology company specializing in developing, manufacturing,
and marketing endovascular stent-grafts that address significant unmet needs in
the repair of aortic aneurysms. Our lead product, Aorfix, is the only abdominal
aortic aneurysm, or AAA, stent-graft approved by the United> States Food and Drug
Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of AAAs with angulation at the neck of
the aneurysm of up to 90 degrees.

An AAA is a balloon-like enlargement of the aorta in the abdominal cavity which,
if left untreated, may rupture. Most ruptured AAAs are fatal. AAAs are the
thirteenth leading cause of death in the United States and the tenth leading
cause of death in U.S. men aged 65 years and older. AAAs are currently treated
either through invasive and traumatic open surgical repair or through less
invasive endovascular aortic repair, or EVAR. According to data produced by
Medtech Ventures, the worldwide EVAR market was estimated to be approximately
$1.4 billion in 2013, with the U.S. market estimated at approximately $680
million according to iData Research, Inc. According to Medtech Ventures, it is
estimated that more than 500,000 AAA patients are diagnosed annually in the
developed world, with 200,000 of such patients receiving treatment. According to
iData Research, Inc., in the United States alone, each year, approximately
200,000 patients are diagnosed with an AAA.

According to Medtech Ventures, approximately 20% of all AAA patients have
aneurysms with neck angulation greater than 60 degrees, which we refer to as
high angle neck anatomy. There are no EVAR devices other than Aorfix approved by
the FDA to treat AAAs with high angle neck anatomy. Our U.S. Pythagoras study
data suggests that an additional approximately 10% of AAA patients with neck
angulation less than 60 degrees have moderate or severe tortuosity, which is 
an abnormality of shape or path, in the iliac arteries, which branch off the 
aorta into the legs. Our data indicates that Aorfix can substantially reduce 
complication and re-intervention rates in this AAA patient group. We plan to 
initially focus on these two groups, the 20% of all AAA patients for which we 
have the only FDA-approved product, and the additional 10% of all AAA patients 
where we believe Aorfix will demonstrate superior performance to other FDA-
approved EVAR devices. 

We also believe we may in the future successfully penetrate the broader AAA
market. We believe data on Aorfix show complication rates in patients whose
aneurysms have neck angulation of 60 degrees or less, which we refer to as low
angle neck anatomy, that are comparable to those of other FDA-approved EVAR
devices in such patients. Clinicians in the United States may prefer to use only
one device, Aorfix, to treat a broader range of AAA patients.

Unlike all other commercially approved stent-grafts in the United States, most
of which use z-shaped, multi-linked stents to support the graft, Aorfix’s
self-expanding stent is formed from a single, continuous wire made of nitinol,
an alloy of nickel and titanium, attached to a proprietary woven polyester
graft. This design makes Aorfix highly flexible, which we believe gives Aorfix
an advantage over other FDA-approved EVAR devices, particularly in the treatment
of the AAA patients with high angle neck anatomy and iliac tortuosity that we
are initially focusing on. We supply Aorfix pre-loaded into a delivery system,
Aorflex, which is designed for accurate placement of Aorfix in the abdominal
aorta. Once Aorfix is properly placed within the abdominal aorta, it provides a
conduit for blood flow, thereby relieving pressure within the weakened or
“aneurysmal” section of the vessel wall, which greatly reduces the potential for
the AAA to rupture.

We formally launched the U.S. roll-out of Aorfix in November 2013 and currently
market Aorfix in the United States through our 20-person direct U.S. sales
force. Our U.S. marketing efforts will initially focus on physicians treating
AAA patients at the top 300 U.S. EVAR centers, at which over 50% of U.S. EVAR
procedures are performed annually. Outside of the United States, we market
Aorfix through our direct sales forces in Germany and the United Kingdom and
through a number of country-exclusive distribution agreements with partners in
other European Union countries and Latin America. We anticipate receiving
regulatory approval to market Aorfix in Japan in 2014.

We are also developing a stent-graft system to treat thoracic aortic aneurysms,
or TAAs, which are aneurysms similar to AAAs but located in the thoracic aorta.
The thoracic aorta begins at the heart, ascends and then descends through the
chest into the abdomen. The thoracic aorta turns through a 180 degree bend on
exit from the heart, referred to as the aortic arch, and is protected by the rib
cage. According to Medtech Ventures, the worldwide TAA market was valued at
approximately $380 million in 2013, and is estimated to grow to more than $480
million by 2018. Similar to AAAs, TAAs are treated either by open surgical
repair or by thoracic endovascular aortic repair, or TEVAR. The rib cage makes
open surgery highly invasive and, consequently, TEVAR more attractive. Within
the TEVAR market, we believe that there are benefits from having a highly
flexible stent-graft and we have built prototype TEVAR devices that have this
characteristic. We expect these designs to show benefits in treating the severe
curvature of the aortic arch similar to the benefits Aorfix shows in treating
angled AAAs. The thoracic stent-graft we are developing also has potential
applications in treating patients with dissections of the thoracic aorta, which
are tears in the inner wall of the aorta, and partial transections of the
thoracic aorta, which are ruptures.

We continue to make progress in the area of new product development and are
planning new versions of Aorflex, which will include reduced device profile and
allow repositioning of the graft top-end to further enhance physician accuracy
in placing the stent-graft. We have also made significant progress toward
expanding the size range of Aorfix, thereby addressing the needs of patients
with AAAs having aortic neck diameters either too large or too small for the
current product size range.

Company Description,"Born in the Mediterranean. Raised in the South. Bringing Mediterranean
Mainstream.

Zoës Kitchen is a fast growing, fast casual restaurant concept serving a
distinct menu of fresh, wholesome, Mediterranean-inspired dishes delivered with
Southern hospitality. Founded in 1995 by Zoë and Marcus> Cassimus in Birmingham,
Alabama, Zoës Kitchen is a natural extension of Zoë Cassimus' lifetime passion
for cooking Mediterranean meals for family and friends. Since opening our first
restaurant, we have never wavered from our commitment to make our food fresh
daily and to serve our customers in a warm and welcoming environment.

We believe our brand delivers on our customers' desire for freshly-prepared food
and convenient, unique and high-quality experiences. As a result, we have
delivered strong growth in restaurant count, comparable restaurant sales, AUVs,
revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. We have grown from 21 restaurants across seven
states, including five franchised locations, in 2008 to 111 restaurants across
15 states, including six franchised locations, as of February 24, 2014,
representing a compound annual growth rate (""CAGR"") of 38.1%. Our Company-owned
restaurants have generated 16 consecutive fiscal quarters of positive comparable
restaurant sales growth, due primarily to increases in customer traffic, which
we believe demonstrates our growing brand equity. We have grown our
Company-owned restaurant AUVs from approximately $1.1 million in 2009 to
approximately $1.5 million in 2013, representing an increase of 32.9% over that
time period. From 2009 to 2013, our total revenue increased from $20.8 million
to $116.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $0.9 million to
$10.9 million. We generated a net loss of $2.8 million and $3.7 million in 2009
and 2013, respectively. Our growth in comparable restaurant sales since 2009 has 
allowed us to invest significant amounts of capital to drive growth through the 
opening of new restaurants and the hiring of personnel required to support our 
growth plans.

Our Concept

Delivering Goodness in the Communities We Serve.

The word ""zoë,"" which means ""life"" in Greek, is embraced in every aspect of the
Zoës Kitchen culture and is a key component of our concept. Our mission is to
""deliver goodness to our customers, from the inside out"" by: (i) offering a
differentiated menu of simple, tasty and fresh Mediterranean cuisine
complemented with several Southern staples; (ii) extending genuine Southern
hospitality with personality, including food delivered to your table;
(iii) providing an inviting, cosmopolitan, casual-chic environment in our
restaurants; and (iv) delivering an outstanding catering experience for business
and social events. Our menu offers high-quality meals made from scratch
generally using produce, proteins and other ingredients that are predominantly
preservative- and additive-free, including our appetizers, soups, salads, and
kabobs. We believe our team members are a reflection of our customers-educated,
active and passionate-and embrace our culture of providing engaging, attentive
service, which we believe helps drive brand advocacy. We believe we deliver a
compelling value proposition by offering flavorful food that our customers feel
good about eating and providing friendly customer service in a warm, inviting
atmosphere, all for an average per customer spend of $9.57 for 2013. Our food,
including both hot and cold items, is well suited for catering to a variety of
business and social occasions, and we believe our strong catering offering is a
significant competitive differentiator that generates consumer trial of our menu
and provides additional opportunities for existing customers to enjoy our food
off-premise. For 2013, catering represented approximately 17% of our revenue.

We believe we provide an emotional connection to our target customer — educated,
affluent women and their families — who represent approximately 70% of our
customer visits, based on internal estimates and third-party data. We promote
our brand as an extension of our customers' own kitchens by offering
high-quality food inspired by family recipes which reminds them of food they may
have prepared at home, while allowing them to spend extra time with family and
friends to fuel a balanced and active lifestyle. We believe our menu is
appealing during both lunch and dinner, resulting in a balanced day-part mix of
approximately 60% lunch and 40% dinner (excluding catering) for 2013.

blood vessels in tumors as an entry portal into tumor tissue, followed by active
uptake into tumor cells and the sustained release of the anti-cancer payload
inside the tumor cells.

Our lead product candidate, CRLX101, is in Phase 2 clinical development and has
the potential to address an unmet need where existing cancer therapies fail. We
believe CRLX101, which contains camptothecin as its anti-cancer payload, is a
potent, durable and combinable inhibitor of topoisomerase 1, or topo 1, a
commercially validated cancer target, and hypoxia inducible factor, or HIF, a
novel target of increasing interest in cancer research. Recent research suggests
that HIF-1a is a master regulator of multiple cancer cell survival pathways.

CRLX301, the second product candidate from our dynamic tumor targeting platform,
is a nanopharmaceutical with docetaxel, a potent and durable microtubule
stabilizer, as its anti-cancer payload. We expect to commence a clinical trial
of CRLX301 by the end of 2014.

executives have managed vessels in the LPG market since 2002> and we currently
own and operate four LPG carriers, including three modern 82,000 cbm VLGCs and
one pressurized 5,000 cbm vessel, through our management function which is to be
brought in-house from our existing managers by the end of the second calendar
quarter of 2014. In addition, we have newbuilding contracts for the construction
of 19 new fuel-efficient 84,000 cbm VLGCs at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.
(“Hyundai”) and Daewoo Shipping and Marine Engineering Ltd. (“Daewoo”), both of
which are based in South Korea, with scheduled deliveries between July 2014 and
January 2016.

Our strategy is to become one of the leading owners and operators of modern
fuel-efficient VLGCs and capitalize on the growing global market for LPG
transportation services. We expect demand for VLGCs to increase as long-haul and
large-volume LPG trade increases, due in part to the growth of U.S. shale oil
and gas production and significant demand for LPG from Asia. VLGCs are the most
cost-effective vessels for the transportation of increasingly larger volumes of
LPG on longer routes between exporting and importing regions. We also believe
that the VLGC segment presents positive fundamentals and high barriers to entry
arising from limited global shipyard capacity for VLGCs and the technical
complexity of operating LPG carriers.

Our customers include global energy companies such as Statoil and Shell,
commodity traders such as Petredec, and industrial users. We believe that we
have established a reputation as a safe and reliable operator of modern and
technically advanced LPG carriers supporting our customers’ global LPG supply
chains. We also believe that these attributes, together with our strategic focus
on structuring charter arrangements that meet our customers’ maritime
transportation needs, have contributed to our ability to attract leading
charterers as our customers. We intend to pursue a balanced chartering strategy
by employing our vessels on a mix of multi-year time charters, some of which may
include a profit-sharing component, as well as on spot market voyages and
shorter-term time charters. We believe this strategy will provide us with a base
of stable cash flows and high utilization rates and allow us to capitalize on
profitable shorter duration opportunities, while maintaining a reasonable level
of exposure to the potential downside risk of a decrease in spot market charter
rates. Three of our four vessels in the water are currently employed on time
charters that are set to expire in 2014, and one vessel is employed in the spot
market.

Company Description,"Sportsman's Warehouse was founded in 1986 as a single retail store in Midvale,
Utah and has grown to 47 stores across 18 states. Today, we have the largest
outdoor specialty store base in the Western United States and Alaska. Our stores
range from 30,000 to 65,000 gross square feet, with an average> size of
approximately 48,000 gross square feet. Our store layout is adaptable to both
standalone locations and strip centers. Based on publicly available information,
we believe it is less capital-intensive for us to open new stores compared to
our principal competitors because our ""no frills"" store layout requires less
initial cash investment to build out and our stores generally require less
square footage than the stores of our competitors. Together, these features
enable us to effectively serve markets of multiple sizes, from Metropolitan
Statistical Areas, or MSAs, with populations of less than 75,000 to major
metropolitan areas with populations in excess of 1,000,000, while generating
consistent four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margins and returns on invested capital
across a range of store sales volumes. We believe that the foregoing attributes
have positioned us to deliver strong financial results, as evidenced by the
following:

    •   Organic store unit growth of 42.3% over the past three fiscal years,
        representing a compound annual growth rate of 12.5%;

    •   Positive same store sales growth of 13.1% and 25.3% for fiscal years 2011

    •   Strong and consistent new store performance, with an average four-wall
        Adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.8% in the first twelve months of operations
        and an average pre-tax payback period of less than one year excluding
        initial inventory cost (or an expected average pre-tax payback period of
        less than 2.5 years including initial inventory cost) for our eight most
        recently opened stores that have been open for a full twelve months;

    •   Net sales of $656.5 million for the 53-week period ended November 2, 2013,

Company Description,"We are one of the largest orthopedic medical device companies in the world, with
operations in more than 50 locations and distribution in more than 90 countries.
We design, manufacture and market surgical and non-surgical products used
primarily by orthopedic surgeons and other musculoskeletal> medical specialists.

Since our founding in 1977, we have grown to nearly 9,000 employees and
generated more than $3.0 billion of net sales in our most recent fiscal year. We
have continually increased annual revenues, with fiscal 2013 representing our
36th consecutive year of net sales growth. We believe our success is largely
attributable to our dedication to excellence in product engineering and
innovation, and our responsiveness to our customers through service and support.
In recent years, we have built on our core competencies in hip and knee products
by expanding our business in higher-growth categories, such as sports medicine,
extremities and trauma, and in our higher-growth international markets. We
operate globally in markets that we estimate collectively exceed $40 billion in
annual sales.

Our product categories include:

• Reconstructive Products—Hips and Knees: Orthopedic reconstructive    
  implants are used to replace joints that have deteriorated as a      
  result of disease (principally osteoarthritis) or injury. Our fiscal 
  2013 net sales were $632.7 million (20.7% of total net sales) for hip
  products and $940.0 million (30.8% of total net sales) for knee      
  products, representing a combined increase of over two additional    
  percentage points of global market share since the beginning of 2007.

• Sports, Extremities and Trauma (S.E.T.) Products: In sports medicine,
  we primarily manufacture and market a line of procedure-specific     
  products for the repair of soft tissue injuries, most commonly used  
  in the knee and shoulder. Extremity systems comprise a variety of    
  joint replacement systems, primarily for the shoulder, elbow and     
  wrist. Trauma hardware includes internal and external fixation       
  devices used by orthopedic surgeons to set and stabilize fractures.  
  Our fiscal 2013 net sales for S.E.T. products were $600.1 million    
  (19.7% of total net sales).                                          

• Spine, Bone Healing and Microfixation Products: Our spinal products  
  include traditional, minimally-invasive and lateral access spinal    
  fusion and fixation systems, implantable electrical stimulation products for
  spinal applications and osteobiologics (including allograft services). Our
  bone healing products include non-invasive electrical stimulation devices
  designed to stimulate bone growth in the posterior lumbar spine and
  appendicular skeleton. Our microfixation products primarily include neuro,                 
  craniomaxillofacial, or CMF, and cardiothoracic products for fixation and
  reconstructive procedures. Our fiscal 2013 net sales for spine, bone healing
  and microfixation products were $408.8 million (13.4% of total net sales).                                 

• Dental Reconstructive Products: Our dental reconstructive products are
  designed to enhance oral rehabilitation through the replacement of teeth and
  the repair of hard and soft tissues. These products include dental
  reconstructive products and related instrumentation, bone substitute
  materials, regenerative products and materials, computer-aided
  design/computer-aided manufacturing, or CAD/CAM, copings and implant bridges.
  Our fiscal 2013 net sales for Dental Reconstructive products were $257.0
  million (8.4% of total net sales).                                                              

• Cement, Biologics and Other Products: We manufacture and distribute  
  numerous other products, including bone cement and accessories, autologous
  blood therapy products and services, operating room supplies, general
  surgical instruments, wound care products and other surgical products. Our
  fiscal 2013 net sales for cement, biologics and other products were $214.3
  million (7.0% of total net sales).    

Consistent with our heritage of engineering excellence and innovation, our
product portfolio incorporates a number of advanced, highly-differentiated
technologies that are applicable across multiple product categories, allowing us
to magnify their market impact and leverage our research and development
investments. These cross-platform technologies include specialized materials
designed to improve the longevity of implants, proprietary surfaces and coatings
to promote biologic fixation, and patient-specific implants and positioning
guides designed using CT or MRI imaging data.

We believe our culture promotes teamwork, decentralized decision-making and the
empowerment of our “can-do family” of team members. Our “One Surgeon. One
Patient.”® philosophy reminds us that each device we make represents a singular
event that will change a patient’s life, encouraging us to approach our work as
if each patient were a friend or family member. We owe our engineering-driven,
entrepreneurial spirit in large measure to the inspiration of our founders,
including Dane A. Miller, Ph.D., a materials science and biomedical engineer who
served as our former long-term CEO and remains a member of our Board of
Directors.

Our products are marketed by more than 3,000 sales representatives worldwide. We
believe that the strength and stability of our sales force differentiates us and
creates opportunities for us to further penetrate our markets. In the United
States, our products are marketed primarily through a network of exclusive
independent distributors and sales agents who carry a broad range of our
products. Outside the United States, we tailor our approach to distribution by
product group and geographic market, and we utilize a combination of direct
sales representatives, independent third-party distributors and independent
commissioned sales agents.

Company Website,http://www.quotientbd.com
CEO,Paul Cowan
Company Description,"We are an established, commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to
reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the development and
commercialization of innovative tests for blood grouping and serological disease
screening, commonly referred to as transfusion diagnostics.> Blood grouping
involves specific procedures performed at donor or patient testing laboratories
to characterize blood, which includes antigen typing and antibody
identification.

Through our subsidiary Alba Biosciences Limited, or Alba, we have over 30 years
experience manufacturing and supplying conventional reagent products used for
blood grouping within the $2.8 billion global transfusion diagnostics market. We
are developing MosaiQTM, our proprietary technology platform, to better address
the comprehensive needs of this large and established market. We believe
MosaiQTM has the potential to be a transformative technology, significantly
reducing the cost of blood grouping in the donor and patient testing
environments, while improving patient outcomes.

Transfusion medicine demands the highest standard of performance, quality and
service. However, there has not been a major advancement in the automation of
transfusion diagnostics over the past two decades. Consequently, complex and
expensive manual testing procedures remain necessary in both donor and patient
testing laboratories. We believe that, if approved for sale, MosaiQTM will be
the first commercially available, fully automated testing platform capable of
simultaneously identifying all clinically significant blood-group antigens and
antibodies in either donor or patient blood, eliminating manual testing.
MosaiQTM is also designed to perform all currently mandated serological disease
screening tests, such as HIV and Hepatitis, and enable the low cost detection of
additional pathogens, thereby increasing the safety of the blood supply.

We have designed MosaiQTM to offer a breadth of diagnostic tests that is
unmatched by any commercially available transfusion diagnostic instrument
platform. Time to result for MosaiQTM will be significantly quicker than
existing methods for extended antigen typing and antibody identification and is
expected to be equivalent to the time to result for current instrument platforms
performing basic antigen typing. We believe that customer adoption of MosaiQTM
will lead to improved patient outcomes through better and easier matching of
donor and patient blood, given cost-effective extended antigen typing. Improved
patient outcomes using MosaiQTM include the potential for reduced incidence of
alloimmunization, where the patient develops allo-antibodies to foreign antigens
introduced to the body through transfused blood. MosaiQTM will also offer the
opportunity for substantial cost savings and a range of operational efficiencies
for donor and patient testing laboratories.

Our internal feasibility studies have demonstrated a high degree of concordance,
across a range of key blood group specificities, between results generated using
the MosaiQTM methodology and results generated using predicate technologies for
blood grouping. We used column agglutination technology (or CAT) and, where CAT 
was not feasible, manual testing techniques, as the predicate technologies for 
our internal feasibility studies. Our antigen typing feasibility study 
demonstrated concordance of approximately 99% or greater for most tested 
specificities and our antibody identification feasibility study demonstrated 
overall concordance of 99.7%. We are continuing to optimize our blood grouping 
tests for MosaiQTM.

MosaiQTM will comprise two separate consumables, one for blood grouping and one
for serological disease screening, and initially a high-throughput instrument.
We expect to install the manufacturing system for the consumables and begin
formal validation studies of the system by the end of 2014. Prototype units of
the initial MosaiQTM instrument are also forecasted to be available at this
time. We plan to commence formal field trials for the consumables and the
initial MosaiQTM instrument in the second half of 2015 and we expect to file the
necessary regulatory submissions to obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA, and other required marketing clearances in the first half of 2016. We
anticipate initial commercial sales of MosaiQTM consumables, for research use
only, in the first half of 2016. If approved for sale, we anticipate full
commercial launch for MosaiQTM in Europe during the second half of 2016 and in
the United States during the first half of 2017.

Through Alba, which we acquired in 2007, we have a proven track record and
significant expertise in product development, manufacturing and quality,
uniquely tailored to the highly regulated transfusion diagnostics market. Since
we acquired Alba, we have introduced a range of FDA-licensed products in the
United States under the Quotient brand, which we sell directly to donor testing
laboratories, hospitals, and independent testing laboratories. We have also
increased our emphasis on the development, manufacture, and sale of conventional
reagent products to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, such as Ortho
Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (or Ortho), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (or Bio-Rad)
and Grifols S.A. (or Grifols).

outstanding capital stock of JRSIS Health Care Limited, a privately held Limited
Liability Company registered in the British Virgin Islands (“JHCL”) for Twelve
Million (12,000,000) shares of our common stock. JHCL,> through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Runteng Medical Group Co., Ltd (“Runteng”), holds majority ownership
in Harbin Jiarun Hospital Co., Ltd, a company duly incorporated, organized and
validly existing under the laws of China (“Jiarun”). We provide full scale
medical services in the Heilongjiang region in China. As the parent company, we
rely on Jiarun to conduct One Hundred Percent (100%) of our businesses and
operations.

Established in February 2006, Harbin Jiarun Hospital Co., Ltd is a privately
held, full medical service hospital established in Harbin City of Heilongjiang,
China. Jiarun is serving in a municipal and county level and providing both
Western and Chinese medical practices to the citizens of Harbin. Strategically
located in the heart of Harbin, the Hospital has over 3,200 square meters of
space spread out over 7 stories for residential and walk-in clinic patients,
emergency treatments, radiology and day to day management. With over 150 open
medical beds and 160 medical staffers (36 non-medical personnel), the Hospital
is capable of serving as much as 4,315 inpatients and 263 thousand outpatients
on an annual basis.

Equipped with over 93 pieces of the medical equipment, the Hospital provides
well rounded medical services to all of its patients. From less complicated
services such as Dentistry to highly sophisticated operations such as General
Surgery, the Hospital’s staff are prepared to provide immediate medical
treatment services throughout all 24 hours of the day. In just 2013 alone, the
Hospital has conducted about 4,100 inpatient, representing approximately 95% of
the hospital’s maximum medical capacity.

The Hospital is currently run by a staff of 160 medically trained personnel and
supported by 36 non- medical staff for day to day office work. In the year 2013,
the Hospital had served about 4,100 inpatient while providing clinical services
to as much as 250 thousand outpatients. Of the many services provided by the
Hospital, Internal Medicine and Surgery Performance account for as much as
57.37% of Jiarun’s revenue source.

On a three (3) year basis, Jiarun’s revenue has been growing at a compound rate
of approximately 28.00% annually and the Hospital anticipates this trend will
slow down but will remain in the high double digits as long as Jiarun’s facility
operates at current level of patient and services efficiency. However,
accounting for the fact that the hospital is working close to its maximum
capacity, this growth trend may only extend for only 2 years unless physical
capacity of the hospital is increased. In consideration of this future growth
cap, the management of Jiarun is building a new 26 floors medical facility in
the heart of Harbin City that will contain over 500 open beds and 10-15
operating rooms. The hospital completed the building construction in November of
2013, and it is in the process of decorating, with an anticipated completion
date in the third quarter of 2014.The new hospital will become the largest
medical facility (both private and public) in the municipality.

CEO,Chad Sykes
Company Description,"Indoor Harvest, Corp., through its brand name Indoor Harvest™, is a development
stage company that seeks to become a design build, developer, marketer and
direct-seller of commercial grade aeroponic fixtures and supporting systems for
use in urban Controlled Environment Agriculture (""CEA"") and> Building Integrated
Agriculture (""BIA"").

Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment
without the use of soil or an aggregate medium (known as geoponics). Aeroponic
culture differs from both conventional hydroponics and in-vitro (plant tissue
culture) growing. Unlike hydroponics, which uses water as growing medium and
essential minerals to sustain plant growth, aeroponics is conducted without a
growing medium.  Because water is used in aerponics to transmit nutrients, it is
sometimes considered a type of hydroponics.

Our fixtures and system design are based upon a modular concept in which primary
components are interchangeable providing a level of customization that we
believe based upon our knowledge of the industry is currently not offered by
other aeroponic system manufactures. We are developing our aeroponic fixtures
and systems for use by both horticulture enthusiasts and commercial operators
who seek to utilize aeroponic vertical farming methods within a controlled
indoor environment.

Our products are designed for the production of leafy greens, micro-greens,
fruiting plants and herbs. Our products and systems can also be adapted for a
variety of other uses such as horticulture research, medicinal plant production,
pharmaceutical plant production, plant cloning and hardwood propagation.

Since our inception, we have engaged in the following significant operational
activities:

On November 26, 2011, we began construction of a facility to conduct research
and development in order to provide proof of concept on our prototype fixture
designs. From the period of our inception to December 31, 2013, $30,888, or 15%
of our total operational costs, was incurred for research and development
expenses towards the development of our aeroponic fixture designs. 

On January 11, 2012, we acquired the domain name indoorharvest.com from the
original domain name registrant for $2,000 cash and recorded it as an
indefinite-lived intangible asset. We also registered the domain name
aerofarmer.com for future use.

As of December 31, 2013, we capitalized $9,692 in tooling equipment for our
product line. Tooling equipment includes two molds for our Aeroponic Growth Tray
(“AGT”) fixtures and one mold for our Aeroponic Growth Lid (“AGL”) fixtures.

From inception to December 31, 2013, $42,421, or 20% of our total operational
expenses were related to professional fees. These fees are comprised of the
following:

                       Accounting fees         $12,240 30%
                       Legal fees              $30,181 70%
                       Total professional fees $42,421    

On September 18, 2013, the Company entered into a material transfer agreement
with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab (""MIT Media Lab"") to
provide aeroponic system components and fixtures to be used for the purpose of
developing a wall facade aeroponic system as part of MIT Media Lab's Changing
Places research. The project, MITCityFarm, will focus on urban mobility
networks, decentralized energy infrastructure and transformable housing units to
advance urban agricultural systems. Indoor Harvest, Corp. will be responsible
for providing technical assistance and materials as a ""Technical Systems

Company Description,"We are an exploration mining company. Our President, Secretary and Treasurer, 
Juan Alexi Payamps Dominiguez, incorporated El Caporal Management, SRL in the 
Domincan Republic and Queliz in Nevada in order to seek out and acquire a 
mineral property in the Dominican Republic. With strong gold> prices at that 
time he was interested in acquiring a property where gold might be discovered 
in sufficient quantities to warrant possible future production. We were 
incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 20, 2012 under the name 
“Recursos Queliz, Inc.”
 
On September 18, 2012, we purchased a 100% interest of the Queliz Gold
Concession (“Queliz Concession”) in San Jose de Ocoa, Dominican Republic. The
Queliz Gold Concession consists of 5,200 mining hectares registered with the
Ministry of Mines in the Dominican Republic. The Queliz Concession was acquired
on September 18, 2012 by El Caporal Management, SRL, which is the Recursos
Queliz, Inc.’s wholly owned subsidiary. The Queliz Concession cost $13,000 to
acquire it from the Department of Mines in the Dominican Republic.
 
On September 23, 2012, the subsidiary paid $25,800 for an exploration program on
the Queliz Concession. The geologist carried out work in November 2012 and
prepared a report with recommendations in February 2013. In August 2013, the 
Company paid for additional work on the concession in the amount of $19,778. 
At this time, we do not have sufficient capital to carry out the recommended 
exploration program as set forth by the geologist. The proposed exploration plan 
will cost an estimated amount of $65,753.
 
As at August 31, 2013, we had $18,464 in cash with no other assets. From our
inception on September 20, 2012 through November 30, 2013, we have raised
$90,000 in capital in private placement (through the issuance of 90,000,000
shares of common stock at the price of $0.001 per share to our director). Queliz
has raised no other funds since that time other than an advance from its sole
director and officer in January 2014 in the amount of $25,000.

Our subsidiary, Eye On South Florida, Inc. was incorporated in the State of
Florida on January 18, 2013.  EOSF is actively engaged in the acquisition,
development, production and distribution of television and multi-media
programming content that is for the people and by the people, thus giving a
voice back to communities with good news and entertainment that is conducive to
society. Once the Company “green lights” a production, the business aggressively
produces, distributes, and markets the content to the general public in each
target area, utilizing proprietary technology, to deliver content to tens of
millions of viewers through all communication mediums from our multi-tiered
platforms, located in South Florida.

EOSF is generating revenue from banner advertisements on our website
(www.eyeonsouthflorida.com), commercial productions, event planners, corporate
videos, infomercials, public announcements, pay-per-view live broadcasted
transmissions and advertisers, desiring to promote their productions, events and
brands alongside the various distribution mediums, whereby content is being
aired and/or shared via any and all mediums that the network controls. In
addition, the Company is generating revenue from other production companies
and/or television networks that request on-site filming and/or our original
feeds with the use of our proprietary communication technology and equipment.
Among these types of programming is “feel good” programming and transmission
that we produce and other stations want, due to the type of news and
entertainment in the community that we promote.  Eye On South Florida has been
assisting and providing valuable airtime pro-bono to non-profit organizations
with sponsored ads, in order to promote their fund raising events for important
causes in the community.  Some of our clients currently include Hard Rock Hotel
&amp; Casino, AutoNation, Florida Metro Rail, Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce,
Shino Bay Dermatology, DelVecchio Pizza and Universal Insurance.

The EOSF Network is producing and distributing original news as it unfolds,
along with live and live on tape entertainment programming specials and content
that delivers what main stream does not, to include informative educational
programming for people of all ages in the community, by way of all its
vertically integrated communication mediums. Other sources of revenue such as
proprietary branded merchandising and/or licensing fees derived from sharing
original programming content with other affiliate TV and Satellite stations are
being considered.

EOSF distribution platforms include conventional network television, over the
air digital, cable television, as well as satellite, presently covering 98% of
the populated world. Our technology of simulcasting, delivers content to all
mediums, e.g.: web, mobile phones, tablets and any smart device with 4G or
wireless connectivity, thus providing a wide array of original content
programming, news, marketing merchandising, advertising and distribution.

Each EOSF medium has its own advertising rates and revenue models, depending on
the production clients’ and advertisers’ preferred demographics and target
markets. In addition, EOSF will seek to receive licensure fees from the use of
any proprietary technology that is sub-contracted under a co-production
agreement, coupled with ongoing royalties from original programming and
merchandising that the network negotiates and sells via any and all mediums that
the network controls. Pay-Per-View, live streaming productions are another
source of revenue for EOSF and each transmission, utilizing all of our
proprietary tools and solutions that will be marketed and promoted for optimum
results.

The EOSF television and multi-media content development and production slate
will be financed by the revenues derived from its own media content, commercial
production services, advertiser’s revenues, licensing fees and distribution
capabilities. Additional revenue will be derived through selling programming and
developing quality productions whether originally produced, or co-produced with
other producers and clients interested in producing their own content for
distribution in any of the EOSF Television &amp; Multi-Media mediums that the
Network controls.

The business is developing programming which we believe will provide all of the
necessary capital for the development of our projects. Upon receiving the
necessary capital, the business will be able to operate at the current demand
level as well as continue to produce programming, according to comprehensive
budgets and be able to solicit advertisers to participate in versatile mediums
in return for multiple revenue streams.  Each of our productions, whether
consisting of commercials or programming of any kind, has a separate financial
budget. Each production will leverage this business value and generate more
capital for ongoing operations of the Company.

EOSF management wants to ensure that it develops the proper content for the
proper advertisers and distribution channels, before it heavily engages in the
production of original programming for this business. In the meantime, the EOSF
Network is currently airing content 24/7 in all of the channels that the Network
currently controls including, but not limited to, archiving community news and
entertainment within its www.eyeonsouthflorida.com Internet portal, hence
generating unprecedented viewers from the world wide web, while promoting the
brand and the advertisers whom have already entrusted us to promote their brands
alongside the EOSF Network.

CEO,Peter D. Staple
Company Description,"We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development,
manufacture and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products that
leverage our broad experience in transdermal and transmucosal delivery systems.
Together with our partners, we have successfully developed six> marketed products
in the prescription drug and consumer markets, and we are the sole commercial
supplier of each of those products for our marketing partners. These marketed
products are Clonidine Transdermal Delivery System, or TDS, Fentanyl TDS and
four Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips products. We use our novel transdermal and
transmucosal approaches to bring new products to markets with significant
opportunities. Our development platforms enable transdermal delivery of large
molecules, or biologics, including vaccines, peptides and proteins, as well as
small molecules that are otherwise difficult to deliver in a transdermal dosage
form. Our pipeline includes three partnered products that are the subject of
pending drug marketing applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA. In addition, we have 12 partner- or self-funded programs at earlier stages.

Since 1999, we have built significant know-how and experience in the
development, scale-up and manufacture of complex specialty products and have
formed relationships with our partners that include both the development of new
product formulations and our manufacture of the resulting products. Our partners
include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, or P&amp;G, Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Agile Therapeutics, Inc., as well as several other
multinational pharmaceutical companies. We have the capability to develop and
manufacture our own product candidates and are one of only a few independent
companies that develops and manufactures transdermal products for other parties.
We believe our proprietary manufacturing processes, know-how and custom
equipment give us a distinct competitive advantage over other pharmaceutical,
consumer products and manufacturing companies.

Transdermal drug delivery is the transport of drugs through the skin for
absorption into the body. We have developed two proprietary technology
platforms, Corplex and MicroCor, that we believe offer significant competitive
advantages over existing transdermal approaches. Corplex and MicroCor are
designed to be adapted broadly for use in multiple drug categories and
indications. We use our Corplex technology to create advanced transdermal and
transmucosal systems for small molecules that utilize less of the active
ingredient while achieving the same or better therapeutic effect, that can
adhere well to either wet or dry surfaces, and that can hold additional
ingredients required to aid the diffusion of low-solubility molecules through
the skin without losing adhesion. Our MicroCor technology is a biodegradable
microstructure system currently in development that enables the painless and
convenient delivery of biologics that otherwise must be delivered via injection.
Biodegradable microstructures integrate drug molecules and a biocompatible
polymer. With slight external pressure, the microstructures penetrate the outer
layers of the skin and dissolve to release the drug for local or systemic
absorption. MicroCor is designed to expand the market for transdermal delivery
of biologics, which cannot currently be delivered by other FDA-approved
transdermal technologies.

In addition to commercialized products, we have a number of products in late
stages of development. The most advanced clinical stage product in our pipeline
is AG200-15, which is in Phase 3 development by our exclusive marketing partner,
Agile. AG200-15 is a combined hormonal contraceptive patch designed to deliver
two hormones, ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, through the skin at levels
comparable to low-dose oral contraceptives, in an easy-to-use format over seven
days. Agile has filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of this
product by the FDA, which is required before marketing a new drug in the United
States. The FDA has indicated that Agile's NDA was not sufficient for approval
as originally submitted. Agile is preparing to conduct an additional Phase 3
clinical trial based on this guidance and intends to supplement the NDA with the
results of the additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Based on market research
conducted by Agile, AG200-15 has the potential to reach a peak market share of
9% of hormonal contraceptive prescriptions in the United States. Based upon IMS
data, Agile estimates that each percentage point of market share of hormonal
contraceptive prescriptions in the United States currently represents
approximately $108 million of annual gross sales.

We are developing two additional products utilizing our proprietary technologies
that we plan to advance into Phase 2 trials in 2014 and 2015. MicroCor
hPTH(1-34) utilizes our MicroCor technology to deliver parathyroid hormone, a
peptide for treating osteoporosis that is currently available only in a
refrigerated injectable form. Corplex Tamsulosin is a patch being developed to
deliver tamsulosin to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, or enlarged
prostate. Tamsulosin is a drug that relaxes smooth muscle cells in the prostate
and bladder neck, thereby decreasing the blockage of urine flow that occurs with
an enlarged prostate. It is designed to deliver a controlled dose over several
days and to reduce side effects compared to currently marketed products. We are
not aware of any FDA-approved transdermal systems for delivering either
hPTH(1-34) or tamsulosin.

Company Website,http://www.opower.com
CEO,Daniel Yates
Company Description,"Opower is a leading provider of cloud-based software to the $2.2 trillion
utility industry. Utilities use our software platform to deliver key
customer-facing applications that reduce energy demand and improve customer
perception of the utility. Our software analyzes energy data and> presents
personalized insights to consumers in order to motivate reductions in energy
consumption. These reductions are valued as a source of energy much like a
conventional power plant. We believe that we are poised to transform the way the
utility industry meets energy demand.

Utilities face two critical challenges that our software is built to address.
First, utilities are under political, regulatory and environmental pressure to
build fewer power plants, find cleaner sources of fuel and keep rates low. In
order to accomplish these goals, utilities implement energy efficiency and
demand response programs, which reduce overall and peak usage. Regulatory
mechanisms support these programs by compensating utilities for reducing usage.
Second, utilities need to strengthen their customer relationships. In many parts
of the world, utilities compete for customers, and therefore customer engagement
is critical. In regulated markets, which include much of the United States,
regulators reward utilities for improving customer satisfaction. Utilities
committed an estimated $11 billion to energy efficiency, demand response and
customer engagement programs in 2013 in an effort to address these two
challenges.

Our software is replacing low-tech and hardware-intensive products. Alternative
efficiency programs today primarily consist of subsidies for energy efficient
products, such as air conditioners and light bulbs. A common residential demand
response program is a decades-old hardware switch connected to a pager network
that shuts off the consumer’s air conditioner. Utility marketing efforts are
often limited to traditional mass market approaches, such as bus stop
advertisements and television commercials. We are able to replace these programs
because our software offers measurable results and a better return on investment
to utilities when scaled. Our approach has improved customer sentiment metrics
by a median of 6% and up to 10% in some cases and we helped utilities and their
customers save over 1,900 gigawatt hours of energy in 2013.

We can embed our solutions within utilities’ websites, mobile applications and
customer service interfaces, and deliver individualized emails, text messages,
automated phone calls and mail. In the design of these consumer touch points, we
apply behavioral science insights to actionable patterns identified by our
proprietary data analytics engine, which analyzes hundreds of billions of energy
usage data points. Our cloud-based platform is extensible and configurable, a
necessity to accommodate our customers’ diverse needs on a single code base.

We have developed four interconnected solutions on our platform:

. 2007: Opower Energy Efficiency – Reports and alerts, via mail and email, 
  that compare consumers’ energy use to their neighbors’ and provide targeted 
  energy saving recommendations. 

. 2010: Opower Customer Engagement – Web, mobile, digital alerts and customer 
  service applications that improve customer experience and streamline 
  operations. 

. 2012: Opower Thermostat Management – Mobile and web applications that 
  connect to third-party thermostats in order to control and optimize peak and 
  overall HVAC utilization. 

. 2013: Opower Demand Response – A zero-hardware solution consisting of near 
  real-time text messages, email and automated phone alerts that motivates peak 
  reductions in energy consumption. 
 
We generate revenue from utilities by selling primarily multi-year subscriptions
to our software. As of December 31, 2013, we served 93 utility customers in
eight countries, including 27 of the 50 largest electric utilities in the United
States. We have the opportunity to expand within these existing customers; for
example, the average penetration of our Energy Efficiency solution is
approximately 10% of our utility clients’ customer base. We believe our
addressable market includes 1,300 electric and gas utilities worldwide, serving
650 million households and 60 million businesses.

Because our clients often provide us all of their energy data even when
launching smaller programs, we currently manage data representing 37% of all
U.S. households. The scale and scope of this data enable us to better optimize
the energy-saving performance of our programs and continually improve our
pattern-matching algorithms. We share our proprietary cross-utility insights
with our utility customers, and they see it as a valued benefit. We believe that
as we grow, these network effects will continue to strengthen, and that these
advantages give us a defensible leadership position.

CEO,Ligang Zhang
Company Description,"We are the largest provider in China’s fast growing private preventive
healthcare services market, accounting for approximately 11.6% of market share
in terms of revenue in 2012, according to Frost &amp; Sullivan. Through our
integrated service platform and established nationwide network of> medical
centers and third-party service provider facilities, we provide comprehensive
and high quality preventive healthcare solutions including a wide range of
medical examinations services and value-added services including disease
screening and other services. Our customers are primarily corporate customers
who contract us to provide medical examination services to their employees and
clients and pay for these services at pre-negotiated prices. We also directly
market our services to individual customers. In fiscal 2012, we delivered our
services to approximately 1.9 million individuals in total, including the
employees and clients of our corporate customers.

Chronic diseases are becoming more prevalent in China. According to Frost &amp;
Sullivan, the number of people with hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia
increased 89%, 97% and 71%, respectively, from 2001 to 2012. With the rising
incidence of chronic diseases, more and more people are realizing the importance
and benefits of preventive healthcare services. Currently, medical examinations
are not typically covered by health insurance policies in China. Although the
majority of medical examinations are still performed in public hospitals, an
increasing number of customers are choosing private providers who offer quality
services at affordable prices.

As of December 31, 2013, our nationwide network consisted of 42 self-owned
medical centers, which contributed the majority of our revenue. Our self-owned
medical center network covers 13 of the most affluent cities in China, namely
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Suzhou,
Hangzhou, Chengdu, Fuzhou, Changchun and Jiangyin. We have also supplemented our
self-owned medical center network by contracting with approximately 300
third-party service provider facilities which include selected independent
medical examination centers and hospitals across all of China’s provinces,
creating a nationwide network that allows us to serve our customers in markets
where we do not have self-owned medical centers.

Our nationwide network offers a wide range of medical examination services and
provides a “one-stop” solution to our corporate customers which have a broad
geographic footprint in China. As a single point of contact for our corporate
customers, we provide consistent and high quality services to their employees
and clients in different locations and reduce their administrative burden. We
also provide our customers with professional consultation and medical referrals
for additional as-needed diagnosis or treatment. Our centers are independent of
hospitals and located in prime urban locations with an average size of 2,500
square meters. Equipped with advanced equipment and staffed with experienced
medical professionals, each center provides a comfortable and friendly
environment to our customers.

In fiscal 2012 and for the nine months ended December 31, 2013, we generated 
83.2% and 79.2% of our net revenues from corporate customers, respectively, and
the remainder from individual customers. In fiscal 2012, we served approximately
1.7 million individuals from approximately 11,200 corporate customers in 
various industries including financial services, telecommunications, retail, 
consumer goods and information technology, as well as approximately 206,000 
individual customers. We served 71 of the 100 largest Chinese companies in 2012
as ranked by Forbes , including the ten largest commercial banks, as well as 
many other blue-chip Chinese companies. We also serve many large multinational 
companies in China, including 189 of the companies ranked in the 2013 Fortune 
Global 500. Among our top 50 customers in fiscal 2012, 90% have been our 
customers for more than four years. In addition, to cater to the increasing 
demand for even more extensive and higher quality medical services from 
China’s growing population of high-net-worth individuals, we opened two 
high-end medical examination centers under our iKang Evergreen brand in Nanjing
and Beijing in September and December 2013, respectively. 

We believe that we are at the forefront of the industry with our proprietary
centralized information technology platform. We operate an online and telephonic
health management and consultation system which provides our customers with
convenient and hassle-free access to our nationwide network. We integrate
third-party service providers into our network through customer scheduling and
payment systems. Our information technology systems (i) allow individuals online
and mobile access to their medical examination results and analytical tools that
help them better understand their health conditions, (ii) enable corporate
customers to monitor and analyze aggregated anonymous health data with respect
to their employees, and (iii) enable us to track our operations and internal
performance metrics which help us prioritize our marketing and sales efforts.

each customer interaction with an appropriate agent resource and delivers
relevant customer data to the agent in real-time through integrations with
adjacent enterprise applications, such as customer relationship management
software, to optimize the customer experience and improve agent productivity.
Delivered on-demand, our solution enables our clients to quickly deploy agent
seats in any geographic location with only a computer, headset and broadband
internet connection, and rapidly adjust the number of contact center agent seats
in response to changing business requirements. Unlike legacy on-premise contact
center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment, can be
rapidly deployed and is maintained by us in the cloud.

Our sales model consists of a field sales team that sells our solution into
larger opportunities and a telesales team that sells our solution into smaller
opportunities. We have developed a proven, high velocity, metrics-driven sales
and marketing strategy designed to effectively identify, qualify and close sales
opportunities. We have also developed a large ecosystem of technology and system
integrator partners to help increase awareness of our solution in the market and
drive incremental sales opportunities with new and existing clients.

We provide our solution through a Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, business model
with recurring subscriptions based primarily on the number of agent seats and
minutes of usage of our VCC cloud platform, as well as the specific
functionalities and applications our clients deploy. Our recurring revenue model
combined with strong revenue retention have enhanced our ability to forecast our
financial performance and plan future investments.

Company Description,"Virtual Sourcing, Inc. was formed under the laws of the State of Nevada on July
30, 1999 under the name Heritage Scholastic Corp. On September 12, 2002, the
Company filed a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and became
a fully reporting entity. On January 27, 2005, Heritage> Scholastic Corp. entered
into a Stock Purchase and Share Exchange Agreement with Nano Chemical Systems,
Inc. On February 15, 2005, pursuant to the Stock Purchase and Share Exchange
Agreement, the company changed its name to Nano Chemical Systems Holdings,
Inc. On March 3, 2008, the Company changed its name to Pangenex Corporation. On
May 12, 2008, the Company filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in order to terminate its duty to file reports under Sections 13 and
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On May 1, 2012, the Company
amended its articles of incorporation to authorize Series A and Series B
Preferred Stock. On May 1, 2012, the Company changed its name to Virtual
Sourcing, which was approved by FINRA on August 31, 2012. The Company's focus is
the recycling and remediation of difficult waste streams including fiberglass
materials and other composites into recycled goods that can be sold to
individual and commercial retail consumers.

The Company has begun its project of identifying potential acquisitions for both
recycling of fiberglass waste and creation of end-user products. By acquiring a
broad base of both recyclers and producers, VSI will be positioned to shoulder
the enormous amount of fiberglass waste being produced by manufacturers of
fiberglass and their various customers.

Our subsidiary, Allied Recycling Corp (ARC), is commercializing technologies to
introduce both cost effective recycling methods and production of recycled fiber
products. While these recycled products may compete with certain recycled
plastics, ARC products are unique in that they do not warp, corrode, lose
pigment, burn or melt. In addition, ARC products can be made to any mass,
weight, color or shape required by the customer.

Allied Recycling Corp. solves waste stream problems by removing all recyclable
fiber materials from the clients’ site and transporting them to our various
inventory locations. It is ARC's goal to keep cost neutral prices compared to
dumping at commercial dump sites. We are currently developing a mobile grinding
system that will allow for access to remote sites where materials may be limited
or transportation to distant inventory locations is cost prohibitive.

In conjunction with partners, licensors, and the manufacturers themselves, we
will utilize a number of facilities around the country for recycling of
fiberglass waste and production of useful end-products. Starting in a tri-state
region that includes West Virginia, Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina,
the Company will construct and utilize other facilities and subsidiary companies
near major fiberglass manufacturing hubs. Additional locations will be developed
along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf Coast where abandoned, damaged, or
sunken boats may be salvaged for fiberglass that can then be used to manufacture
our products. In order to pursue its strategic objectives, the Company plans to
utilize a portion of the proceeds received from this offering, as well as its
available cash, cash generated from operations and additional cash as may be
raised via equity or debt offerings as may be approved by its Board of
Directors.

The administrative office of the Company is located at 1200 G St. NW, Suite 800,
Washington, DC 20005. Our telephone number: 877-291-0053.>"
